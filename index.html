        <h1>The Dust Bowl</h1>

        <p>The Dust Bowl is the name applied to a large area in the southern part of the Great Plains region, which suffered extensively from wind erosion during the 1930s. For nearly a decade the dust blew across the Southern Plains.  Women hung wet sheets over doorways and windows in an effort to stop dust from invading their homes.  Children wore dust masks on their way to school and back.  Farmers helplessly watched as their crops blew away.</p>
        <p>The areas that were impacted by the Dust Bowl included parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado. In its original state, the region was covered with hardy grasses that held the fine-grained soil in place in spite of the long recurrent (occurring repeatedly) droughts and occasional heavy rains characteristic of the area. A large number of homesteaders  (someone who grows crops on land given by the government) settled in the region in the 30 years before World War I, planting wheat and row crops and raising cattle. New machines allowed them to farm more land than ever before.  By doing this, the native drought-resistant grasses were replaced with wheat.  The surplus of wheat caused the prices to drop. Many fields were left bare.   These farming practices left the soil exposed to the danger of erosion by the winds that constantly sweep over the land.</p>
        <p>Both man and Mother Nature are responsible for this disaster.  Beginning in the early 1930s, the region suffered a period of severe droughts, and the soil began to blow away. When what little rain the area did receive stopped falling, the soil dries very quickly.  With no grass to hold the dirt in place, the winds easily picked up the dirt and swirled into dust clouds.  The dust clouds, known as “black blizzards,” carried dirt everywhere, even as far as Washington, D.C. and the East Coast. It was impossible to escape it.  Dust covered everything.</p>
        <h2>Questions? and Answers!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> What were two causes of the Dust Bowl?</li>
                <p>Two causes of the Dust Bowl were dry spells and dirt which started to overwhelm territories. At the point when what little downpour the zone received quit falling, the dirt dries rapidly. With no grass to hold the soil set up, the breezes handily got the earth and twirled into dust mists.
                    People had dirt in their clothes, hair, and teeth.  It even covered the food they ate.  Over time, the dust that they breathed and ate built up in their lungs.  This leads to a disease called pneumonia.   The body was often sent into coughing fits in an effort to rid itself of the dust.  Dust pneumonia killed thousands of people.  Babies, children, and the elderly were most likely to die from this.Thousands of families, with their farms ruined, migrated westward.</p>
            <li>How did the Dust Bowl affect the people living in the Great Plains at
                this time?</li>
                <p>There was a decrease in the cleanliness in everyday items,  the purity in the air also went down impacting thousands of people, of various ages, specifically through extreme coughing fits and an introduction to an infamous disease known as pneumonia. The fear of this allowed many to migrate westward.  

                    Due to the conditions in Oklahoma, many people left the state.  Some chose to leave; others were forced out when banks took their homes and lands.  This was the greatest migration in American history.  Of the 2.5 million people that left the plains, 200,000 headed for California.  These “Okies” (slang term for person from Oklahoma) as they were called were not met with a warm welcome.  Many Californians were angry about the competition for the jobs, which were already limited.  Farms there were much different than the ones in Oklahoma: they used more machines and needed fewer people to provide labor.  Some farmers took advantage of the Okies.  With so many people hungry and looking for work, there were able to pay very low wages.</p>
            <li>What is your own definition of a migrant? Where have you heard that term before?</li>
                <p>Migrant is a person who migrates which is the movement and relocation in the intention of finding a new place to settle better than the previous conditions. I have heard the term in immigrants which are people from abroad that settle in a different country. We have also studied topics that included the similar phase, such as the great migration. Known as a movement from the South to the North for Africans in the early to the mid 1900’s</p>
            <li>What were the migrants called when they reached California? Why?</li> 
                <p>They were called “Okies”(which isn’t a bright welcoming way to categorize them) because Calfornians were already faced with a limited amount of work since many farms started turned to use the developing technology that came out during that time which made job opportunities insufficient.
                    Many of the migrants gave up farming when they reached California.  They established homes near larger cities.  These cities were called Little Oklahomans or Okievilles.  These homes were built from scraps and had no electricity or plumbing.  Outbreaks of diseases such as malaria, typhoid, smallpox, and tuberculosis were caused by polluted water.   
                    Beginning in 1935, intensive efforts were made by both federal and state governments to develop adequate programs for soil conservation and for rehabilitation of the Dust Bowl and the Great Plains. Dry spells in the 1950s, '60s, and late '70s were responsible for recurrences of dust storms in the region.</p>
            <li>How were survivors of the Dust Bowl treated in the West? Explain where they lived and how they found employment.</li>
                <p>The survivors of the Dust Bowl were treated poorly in the West, their homes were built out of scraps and didn’t have plumbing or electricity, on top of that there was a risk of new disease outbreaks during that time.</p>
